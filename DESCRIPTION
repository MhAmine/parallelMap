Package: parallelMap
Title: Unified interface to Some Popular Parallelization Back-ends for
    Interactive Usage and Package Development
Description: Map over lists in parallel. Supports local, multicore, mpi
    and BatchJobs mode. Allows "tagging" of the parallel operation
    with a level name that can be later selected by the user to
    switch on parallel execution for exactly this operation.
